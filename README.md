# Design System Coding Challenge

Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! Thanks for considering Bigeye! We're excited you've decided to interview with us.

For this portion of your interview, you will be live-coding a simple Design System in React and TypeScript which we have already scaffolded for you. Your React app will display some data from the API server included in this repo.

## Signup Form Design System

We're going to make a design system that helps us make a form. This form will be used for a newsletter signup.

## Running the environment

This project is a `create-react-app` scaffold. To set up the project, install all project dependencies with `npm install`. You should then be able to work on the code with the command `npm run start`.

As this is `create-react-app`, you can use CSS and CSS Modules. If you wish to use Sass, you can install it with `npm install sass`. [More info about Sass](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet) can be found in the CRA docs.

## Your task

Your task is to create a small design system of components, with the end goal of building this form. All of the visual assets you need are in the [Figma Mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/2Ixi9XrJetSepHpqibhwOv/%5BInterview%5D-onsite-FE-design-system-eng?node-id=113%3A458)

Specifically, you should create basic design system pieces for the following:

- Header
- Body Text
- Input (with the needed the input states)
- Button

As this is a design system, we hope that you can create a demo page showing the different states of these components.

By the end, you should be able to construct a page with the signup form.

## Bonus tasks

- Create a system for organizing brand and product colors
- Adding additional input variants from the designs (readonly/required, description, character count)
